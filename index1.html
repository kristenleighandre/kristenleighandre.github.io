                     Reserve your spot!
                     <ul>
                        Almost every animal cafe requires a reservation. Normally, each cafe will have their schedule and reservation services online but in some cases a phone call might be nessacary.

                  <li>
                     Wash your hands!
                     <ul>
                        This one is important. The animals are being touched by many people so in order to protect the animals and yourself from spreading germs and sickness, wash your hands.
                     </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                     Don't harass the animals!
                     <ul>
                        Pulling, hitting, poking, waking, loud noises, and general harassment is never acceptable, be kind to the animals.
                     </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                     Cameras are cool, but not the flash!
                     <ul>
                        Take as many photos or videos you want but turn off the flash. Animals are easily started by flashes.
                     </ul>

                  <li>
                     Don't feed the animals!
                     <ul>
                        Some cafes have feeding times where you can schedule a time to come a feed the animals.
                     </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                     Some places don't allow children!
                     <ul>
                        Face it, children can be stressful, imagine how animals feel around some of them. Always check in advance with the cafe you wish to visit if they allow children. Most places have have age restrictions.
