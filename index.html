          Cat cafes started in Taipei, Taiwan. The first cafe, Cat Flower Garden, opened in 1998 and began its roots as a way for young urbanites to socialize and unwind. Over time, the trend has since spread to all around the UK/Europe, the US, and other countries worldwide. It has still maintained its foundation as a way to socialize and unwind, but has also morphed into trying out a kitten friendly lifestyle without the commitment of having to feed, house, and care for an actual cat. Pair that with coffee and shenanigans, and you have a local business hub for like-minded people, with some serious niche potential. There is usually a cover charge with offerings such as tea, coffee, and small bites to go along with furry companionship and comaraderie amongst other "cat people".
